# HR Analytics Dashboard - Power BI
I have created a dashboard for analytics of employees in a company, this is useful for the HR department.

## Overview
This project is a Human Resources (HR) Dashboard built using Power BI to address key requirements for effective workforce management. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of employee engagement, attendance, sick leaves, and work-from-home trends. By leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, this tool offers a visually intuitive and interactive interface to facilitate data-driven decision-making for HR professionals and organizational leaders.

## Key Features
1. Working Preference Analysis
- % of Attendance over Time: Track the attendance percentage of employees over a specified period, enabling a comprehensive view of workforce engagement patterns.
- % of Sick Leaves (SL) over Time: Monitor and analyze the trend of sick leaves, helping to identify potential areas for intervention and support.
- % of Work-from-Home (WFH) over Time: Visualize the evolution of work-from-home preferences among employees, aiding in understanding the dynamics of remote work adoption.

2. Attendance Management
Total Attendance %: Gain insights into the overall attendance percentage, allowing for quick assessments of workforce engagement levels.
3. Leave Management
Total Sick Leave %: Calculate the total percentage of sick leaves, facilitating a deeper understanding of employee well-being and potential health-related concerns.

Total WFH %: Understand the prevalence of remote work by analyzing the total percentage of work-from-home arrangements.

4. Detailed Analysis
Reasons for WFH: Explore the reasons behind employees opting for work-from-home, providing valuable information for policy adjustments and decision-making.
